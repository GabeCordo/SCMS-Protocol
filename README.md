# SCMS Protocol

## Description

The Secure Communication and Messaging System is a mid-weight framework/protocol for providing an out-of-the-box solution for simple and advanced TCP networking. Offering ready-to-use entry, relay, 
indexing, balancer, and exit nodes built off of a standard peer-to-peer node. Developed for programmers looking to provide highly-secure 
messaging/file transfer options within there applications without the hassle and complexity involved in implementing highly-customizable 
TCP servers. Supporting end-to-end RSA encryption and anonymous server meshing through the use of relays similar to tor (hence, the name).
