        [To The Documentation ->](https://github.com/GabeCordo/scms-protocol/tree/master/docs)
        
        * TCP Socket Networking 
        * Uses the GORM Markup Language
        * Default asymmetric encryption (RSA keysets) and salting that can be toggled
        * Out of the box packet-routing (tor-like) capabilities for message-origin concealment
        	1. Relays
        	2. Entry/Exit Nodes
        	3. Indexing Server (Creating IP-ID Account related pairs)
        * Customizable Traffic Receivers/Transfer Routines
        
        ## Documentation
        The documentation covers the various aspects being introduced with the SCMP including advanced concepts relating to 
        high-level security and mock tor-like relaying.
        
        ## GORMarkup
        [GORM](https://github.com/GabeCordo/rust-gorm) is an object-relational markup language with built in data-encapsulation and quick data-manipulation.
        
        ## Extensions
        
        ### Manakin
