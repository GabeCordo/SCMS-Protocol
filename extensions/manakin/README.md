# Manakin
#### Reffered to as the (S)e(c)ure (M)es(s)aging Application (SMCS)

    This is a demo-application (and side project) servers are currently not operating due to
    lack-of-funding but the best   efforts have been made to pre-test server applications through
    individual testing of nodes in the pynodetor framework.

## Summary

The Secure Messaging Service establishes a two-way secure transmission of texts between clients. Completes its task through intermediate servers which mask the final destination of the message, using databases to match and id with an associated target IP. Incorporates the use of Python (sockets for networking and program logic), Rust (string-parsing bitstreams into requests through a lightweight markup language) and MySQL (data collection: user-ids and session data).

## Support

Manakin is a terminal-based application, hence, support is primarly dependent on access to a terminal shell with a valid python interpreter installation.
